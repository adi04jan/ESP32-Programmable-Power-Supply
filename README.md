# ‚ö° ESP32C3-Based Voltage-Controlled Power Supply (LM2596, MCP4017, MOSFETs) THrpugh Web Dashboard

A modular, memory-efficient, mobile-friendly web dashboard and hardware solution for a 3-output (variable + fixed) voltage-controlled power supply using ESP32C3 Super Mini, LM2596, MCP4017 digital potentiometer, MOSFETs, MINI360, and LM1117. Includes live voltage feedback, hardware and software files, mDNS access, and OTA update support. 

Designed and developed by **Aditya Biswas**.  
**Release Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## üöÄ  Project Description
This project lets you build a robust voltage-controlled bench power supply with output current up to 3A with error margin of 150mV due to MCP4017 128 step and upto 20V range.

* Output 1 (variable 2.5‚Äì15V, up to 3A) is based on an LM2596 buck converter module, digitally controlled using an I2C MCP4017 potentiometer, with a MOSFET switch for fast, safe output enable/disable.

* Output 2 (5V fixed) uses a Mini360 buck converter;
* Output 3 (3.3V) uses an LM1117 LDO. Both are switched by MOSFETs.

Powered and managed by an ESP32C3 Super Mini (4MB).

The project contains both the complete hardware design (schematics, PCB, BOM) and software for the web dashboard & logic.

## üõ† Installation

1. **Dependencies:**  
   - ESPAsyncWebServer ([latest, compatible with ESP32-C3](https://github.com/ESP32Async/ESPAsyncWebServer))
   - AsyncTCP-esphome ([not classic AsyncTCP](https://github.com/ESP32Async/AsyncTCP))
   - ESPmDNS
   - [SW_MCP4017](https://github.com/SparkysWidgets/SW_MCP4017-Library)

2. **Setup:**
   - Copy the full project to your Arduino IDE/workspace
   - Edit `credential.h` with your WiFi and OTA credentials
   - Flash to your device
   - On first boot, monitor Serial for IP address

3. **Tweaking LM2596 to make it digitally controlled:**
   - To control LM2596 digitally desolder the 10K POT [Blue coloured component] and 330 ohm resistance in series ![alt text](Images/image.png)
   - connect One end of the MCP4017 to 1st pin of POT and another pin of MCP4017 to GND side of the 330 ohm resistor as shown below ![alt text](Images/image-1.png)
   - Solder a 10K resistance from Ouptut to common pad of the POT as shown above such that we have VOUT--10K--FB pin--MCP4017--GND

4. **Access:**
   - Open browser and visit [http://ESP32PS.local](http://ESP32PS.local) (or device IP)
